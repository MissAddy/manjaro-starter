# manjaro-starter
A basic repo with information to make a basic qtile manjaro installation.

HOW TO INSTALL
 
First of all, if you haven't opened a terminal, GO DO THAT!!!

The universal keyboard shortcut for opening the terminal is Ctrl+Alt+T

Now type or copy and paste (The way you paste something in the terminal is Ctrl+Shift+V) the command `sudo pacman -S git` to install git so you can clone the repository to begin with

Now type `git clone https://github.com/MissAddy/manjaro-starter.git`

Once that finishes type `cd manjaro-starter`

Then type `./install-qtile.sh`
That's going to install the tiling window manager that we'll be using along with a few other essential packages and set nearly everything else up for us

Let the script run its course then logout of your current user session. On the login screen (for xfce) click on the xf button down at the bottom right, and click on the `qtile` button, NOT `qtile wayland`

You should be in a fully functional desktop after that, some useful keybinds to know are as follows:

Open Firefox: Win(Super)+Ctrl+F

Open Run Prompt: Win(Super)+R
